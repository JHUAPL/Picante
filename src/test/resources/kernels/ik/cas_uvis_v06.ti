UVIS Instrument Kernel
==============================================================================
 
   This instrument kernel (I-kernel) contains references to the mounting
   alignment, internal and FOV geometry for the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging
   Spectograph (UVIS) instruments.
 
 
Version and Date
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   The TEXT_KERNEL_ID stores version information of loaded project text
   kernels. Each entry associated with the keyword is a string that consists
   of four parts: the kernel name, version, entry date, and type. For example,
   the ISS I-kernel might have an entry as follows:
 
           TEXT_KERNEL_ID += 'CASSINI_ISS V0.0.0 29-SEPTEMBER-1999 IK'

Implementation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make use of
   this instrument kernel must ``load'' the kernel, normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their names
   in a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. The SPICE routine FURNSH
   loads SPICE kernels as shown below:
 
           FORTRAN: (SPICELIB)
 
              CALL FURNSH ( frame_kernel_name )
 
           C: (CSPICE)
 
              furnsh_c ( frame_kernel_name );
 
           IDL: (Icy)
 
              cspice_furnsh, frame_kernel_name
 
           MATLAB: (Mice)
 
              cspice_furnsh( frame_kernel_name )
 
   In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool, the
   SPICE routines GDPOOL, GIPOOL, and GCPOOL (see [2]) and GETFOV are used.
 
   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.
 
 
Naming Conventions
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   All names referencing values in this I-kernel start with the characters
   `INS' followed by the NAIF Cassini spacecraft ID number (-82) followed by a
   NAIF three digit code for the UVIS detectors. (FUV_HI = 840, FUV_LO = 841,
   EUV_HI = 842, EUV_LO = 843, FUV_OCC = 845, EUV_OCC = 846, HSP = 844, HDAC =
   847, SOLAR = 848, SOL_OFF = 849).
 
   The remainder of the name is an underscore character followed by the unique
   name of the data item. For example, the UVIS FUV_HI boresight direction in
   the UVIS FUV frame (``CASSINI_UVIS'' -- see [6] ) is specified by:
 
           INS-82840_BORESIGHT
 
   The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
   characters.
 
   If the same item is included in more than one file, or if the same item
   appears more than once within a single file, the latest value supersedes
   any earlier values.
 
 
UVIS description
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   From [3]:
 
   A spectrograph is an instrument that records spectral intensity information
   in one or more wavelengths of energy and then outputs the data in the form
   of a graph. (A spectrometer, in contrast, outputs spectral information as
   numerical data.) An imaging spectrograph converts the points on the graph
   to digital data that can be output in the form of a visual image, such as a
   "false color" picture.
 
   The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph Subsystem (UVIS) is a set of detectors
   designed to measure ultraviolet light reflected by or emitted from
   atmospheres, rings, and surfaces to determine their compositions,
   distributions, aerosol contents, and temperatures. The UVIS will measure
   the fluctuations of starlight and sunlight as the sun and stars move behind
   the rings and the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn, and it will determine
   the atmospheric concentrations of hydrogen and deuterium. These data will
   be used for studies of the atmospheres, the magnetosphere, and the rings of
   the Saturnian system.
 
   The UVIS has two channels: the extreme ultraviolet channel and the far
   ultraviolet channel. The ultraviolet channels are built into
   weight-relieved aluminum cases, and each contains a reflecting telescope, a
   concave grating spectrometer, and an imaging, pulse-counting detector. The
   UVIS also includes a high-speed photometer channel, a hydrogen-deuterium
   absorption cell channel, and an electronics and control subassembly. For
   information on the UVIS components, see below.
 
   (UVIS)
 
   The extreme ultraviolet channel (EUV) will be used for imaging spectroscopy
   and spectroscopic measurements of the structure and composition of the
   atmospheres of Titan and Saturn. The EUV consists of a telescope with a
   three-position slit changer, a baffle system, and a spectrograph with a
   CODACON microchannel plate detector and associated electronics. The
   telescope consists of an off-axis parabolic section with a focal length of
   100 mm, a 22 mm by 30 mm aperture, and a baffle with a field of view of
   3.67 degrees by 0.34 degrees. A precision mechanism positions one of the
   three entrance slits at the focal plane of the telescope, each translating
   to a different spectral resolution.
 
   The spectrograph uses an aberration-corrected toroidal grating that focuses
   the spectrum onto an imaging microchannel plate detector to achieve both
   high sensitivity and spatial resolution along the entrance slit. The
   microchannel plate detector electronics consists of a low-voltage power
   supply, a programmable high-voltage power supply, charge-sensitive
   amplifiers, and associated logic.
 
   The EUV channel also contains a solar occultation mechanism to allow solar
   flux to enter the telescope when the sun is still 20 degrees off-axis from
   the primary telescope.
 
   The far ultraviolet channel (FUV) will be used for imaging spectroscopy and
   spectroscopic measurements of the structure and composition of the
   atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and of the rings. The FUV is similar to the
   EUV channel except for the grating ruling density, optical coatings, and
   detector details. The FUV electronics are similar to those for the EUV
   except for the addition of a high-voltage power supply for the ion pump.
 
   The high-speed photometer channel (HSP) will perform stellar occultation
   measurements of the structure and density of material in the rings. The HSP
   resides in its own module and measures undispersed (zero-order) light from
   its own parabolic mirror with a photomultiplier tube detector. The
   electronics consists of a pulse-amplifier-discriminator and a fixed-level
   high-voltage power supply.
 
   The hydrogen-deuterium absorption cell channel (HDAC) will be used to
   measure hydrogen and deuterium in the Saturn system using a hydrogen cell,
   an oxygen cell, a deuterium cell, and a channel electron multiplier (CEM)
   detector to record photons not absorbed in the cells. The hydrogen and
   deuterium cells are resonance absorption cells filled with pure molecular
   hydrogen and deuterium, respectively. They are located between an objective
   lens and a detector. Both cells are made of stainless steel coated with
   teflon and are sealed at each end with MgF2 windows. The electronics
   consists of a pulse-amplifier-discriminator, a fixed-level high-voltage
   power supply, and two filament current controllers.
 
   The UVIS microprocessor electronics and control subassembly consists of
   input-output elements, power conditioning, science data and housekeeping
   data collection electronics, and microprocessor control elements.

   From [7], [8], and [9] we have:
 
 
           Rectangular FOVs:

   The keywords INS[ID]_FOV_FRAME, INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE, INS[ID]_BORESIGHT, and
   FOV ANGLE specification keywords defined below are used to describe the
   instrument field of view. Since the HDAC has a circular field of view and
   the others are rectangular, the INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE will either be 'CIRCLE'
   or 'RECTANGLE'. In the case of the HDAC, GETFOV returns a single boundary
   vector that lies along the edge of the circular cone, and for the others
   four vectors. All FOV boresights lie along the Z-axis in their respective
   frames.
 
 
Far Ultraviolet Spectrograph High (FUV_HI) FOV Definition
 
   Since FUV_HI is a rectangular field of view, four boundary corner vectors
   require visualization. This means two separate calculations. First consider
   looking down the X-axis at the X=0 plane which permits the computation of
   the Y components of the boundary corner vectors. In this plane the half
   angle of note is 1.83346495 degrees. (Note we are arbitrarily choosing a
   vector that terminates in the Z=1 plane.)

   Now from here we see that the Y component of one boundary corner vector is:
 
           Y Component = +/- 1.0 * tan ( 1.83346495 degrees )
                       = +/- 0.03201093
 
   Since the field of view is rectangular a similar computation yields the X
   components. This time look up the Y-axis at the Y=0 plane. The half angle
   of interest is 0.02148592 degrees.

                       = +/- 3.75000064D-4
 
   This results in the following FOV definition:

Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrograph Occultation Port (EUV_OCC) FOV Definition
 
   EUV_OCC is also a rectangular field of view. Four boundary corner vectors
   require visualization. First consider looking down the X-axis at the X=0
   plane which permits the computation of the Y components of the boundary
   corner vectors. In this plane the half angle of note is 1.83346495 degrees.
   (Note we are arbitrarily choosing a vector that terminates in the Z=1
   plane.)

   Since the field of view is rectangular a similar computation yields the X
   components. This time look up the Y-axis at the Y=0 plane. The half angle
   of interest is 0.229183 degrees.

Hydrogen - Deuterium Absorption Cell (HDAC) FOV Definition
 
   HDAC's FOV is circular; it's diameter is 3.2 degrees, looking up the Y-axis
   in the CASSINI_UVIS_HDAC frame we have: (Note we are arbitrarily choosing a
   vector that terminates in the Z=1 plane.)

UVIS Pixel Parameters
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   These parameters describe the pixel structure associated with the
   instruments and their fields of views. In some cases this is a
   generalization of the notion of pixel, in that instead of representing
   pixels on a CCD they may represent a collection of individual detectors.

           the INS..._TRIGGER_OFFSET and INS..._CYCLE_DURATION
           keywords.
 
           INS..._TRIGGER_OFFSET specifies the reference time of the
           first instrument frame (to be calculated for a footprint)
           relative to the time of transacting the corresponding TRIGGER
           command. The units are SFOC duration.
