<h2>Monitoring Progress</h2>
Here are the rules for using progress monitors in your code.

The progress monitor framework is a mechanism which attempts to address
the following concerns:
<ol>
<li>providing an easy way to perform long-running operations to run in a non-GUI thread</li>
<li>allowing long-running operations to be cancelled by the user</li>
<li>providing a progress indicator for long tasks</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are three interfaces in this framework, plus some classes that implement them.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
the <code>IProgressMonitor</code> interface<br/>
It defines how long running tasks interact with the object that
is displaying some kind of progress.
</li>
<li>
the <code>IRunnableWithProgress</code> interface<br/>
This is to be implemented by all long running jobs and it offers a way to hand off
a long running job to something that can do this job on another thread.
</li>
<li>
the <code>IRunnableContext</code> interface<br/>
This captures the "thing that runs the job on another thread" from the previous
interface. Objects implementing this interface take an <code>IRunnableWithProgress</code>
and execute it on another thread, passing in a progress monitor to the <code>run()</code>
method of the runnable object.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Progress monitor functionality is captured as an interface which is modeled closely after
that found in the Eclipse source code.
An IProgressMonitor object is passed into a long running job, and it
is that job's responsibility to both notify the monitor of changes
in the state of the job (task started, work performed, task done)
and to check the progress monitor for cancellation requests.
When a cancellation request is detected, the job should
clean up after itself and throw an InterreuptedException.
(I have provided a convenience class CancelledException which
inherits from InterruptedException).
</p>

<p>
The framework incorporates a mechansim for long running tasks
to spawn sub-tasks, and in this case, you create a sub-task
progress monitor that connects back to the parent monitor
and is assigned a certain amount of the parent monitor's work.
</p>

<h3>Here are the rules for using a progress monitor within a long running task. </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Trap all exceptions.</h3>
The <code>run(IProgressMonitor pmon)</code> method cannot throw anything.
This is because the caller of this method is far removed from the actual
task and cannot be excpeted to know how to handle these exceptions.
</li>
<li>
<h3>One method, one progress monitor.</h3>
The main rule is that if your method initiates a progress monitor with a
call to <code>taskStarted()</code>, then that method should most certainly
be the place where the <code>taskDone()</code> method is called.
The progress monitor passed into a method is completely devoted
to the task in that method. So that method decides how much work
to start the task with, and how much work to report along the way
(these should ultimately agree). You can actually report slightly
less work than you started the task with, but if you report more,
the progress monitor will think the task is done and may decide
to close down (hiding the Cancel button in the process!)

<br/>
This approach anticipates the use of sub-task monitors. Your method does
not know if its task is the entire task, or just a sub-task. But it
doesn't have to. Sub tasks are each sent their own freshly minted progress
monitor which is wholly theirs to start and complete.
<br/>
Here is an example of an outline for a long running method:
<pre>
  public void run(IProgressMonitor pmon)
  {
     try {
        int work = 1000; // use big numbers here (not 10s, but at least hundreds)

        pmon.taskStarted(activityLabel, work);

        ... do work, report progress, check for cancel...
        pmon.reportWorkDone(100); // do this 10 times

        if (pmon.hasCancelBeenRequested()) {
           ... close up job...
           // throw interrupted exception
           throw new InterruptedException("Job X Cancelled!");
        }

       ... not shown here: catching and dealing with all exceptions ...
       
     } finally {
     
        // no matter what, you are responsible for completing this task
        // (otherwise, the progress window will be stuck on the screen!)

        pmon.taskDone();
     }
  }
</pre>
One instance where you don't have to make sure to call the
<code>taskDone()</code> method is if you are just passing
a progress monitor through. For example, if you have a method
which does not do any work, but just calls another
method that does the work, then you can just pass through the progress
monitor. If you start calling its methods though, it becomes yours!
<pre>
   private void run(IProgressMonitor pmon)
   {
      // some internal method in your class that does the actual
      // work based on some parameters in the class

      try {
        //Notice that the doRealWork method can throw Exceptions
        // Lots of long running operations will throw exceptions.
        // But the method implementing the method on the 
        // IRunnableWithProgress interface must catch them all.
        
        doRealWork( url, settings, pmon);

      } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
         ... put up a popup window ...
      }
   }
</pre>
</li>
<li> <h3>Wrapping the <code>run</code> method</h3>
Many of your long-running tasks will take progress monitors but will also
take other parameters and will throw all kinds of exceptions. This is fine.
These method calls just need to be wrapped by an anonymous inner class
meeting the <code>IRunnableWithProgress</code> interface.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Progress Monitor Implementations</h3>
<p>
There are 2 implementations of the IProgressMonitor interface. One is GUI based.
Oddly enough, the GUI popup progress monitor does not implement the
<code>IProgressMonitor</code> interface. It implements the <code>IRunnableContext</code>
instead, and then you just give it the runnable and it takes care of everything.
</p>

<p>
The other implementation is an ASCII version, and it does implement
the <code>IProgressMonitor</code> interface, in case you want
to just throw a quick and dirty progress monitor at a long
running operation that is running in a batch thread or some other
non-GUI thread.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of an action listener on a button that
starts a long-running job which talks to a progress monitor.
</p>
<pre>
      JButton loadTextURLButton = new JButton("Load Text URL");
      loadTextURLButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
         public void actionPerformed(@SuppressWarnings("unused")
         ActionEvent evt)
         {
            IRunnableWithProgress runnable = new IRunnableWithProgress() {
               @Override
               public boolean isCancellable()
               {
                  return true;
               }
               @Override
               public void run(IProgressMonitor pmon)
               {
                  // method on enclosing class - this one should be very short
                  // and if it throws exceptions, you would have to deal with
                  // them here!
                  URL url = getUrlFromAnotherMethodInThisClass();
                  doLongOperation(url, pmon);
               }
            };

            boolean isModal = false;
            String title = "Executing my long running operation";
            long millisecToPopUp = 300L;
            ProgressMonitorPopUpDialog popup = new ProgressMonitorPopUpDialog(
                     jframe, title, isModal, millisecToPopUp);

            popup.run(runnable);
         }

      });
</pre>

Here is an example of a method that does the long operation:
<pre>
   public void doLongOperation(URL url, IProgressMonitor pmon)
   {
      // maybe we know how much data is in the URL:
      int numBytes = getLength(u);

      // use those bytes as the number of units of work to do
      int totalWorkUnits = numBytes;
      int label = "Reading from file";
      try {
         // you have to start the task
         pmon.taskStarted(label, totalWorkUnits);

         // If you don't know the totalWorkUnits, just use any (positive) number there,
         // and then call this method to tell the progress monitor you don't really know
         // how much work there is:
         // pmon.setIndeterminate(true);
         // Be careful not to add too much work to the task.
         

         // you can set the activity label of the task
         pmon.setCurrentActivityLabel("Reading data from " + url.toString());

         // Here is the main work - note that thiscan throw IOexception
         // (and your operation will throw any number of exceptions)
         Data data = new Data();
         for (int i=0; i&lt;numBytes; i++) {
            data.addSomeMoreData( readOneByteFromUrl(url));
            pmon.reportWorkDone(1);
            if (pmon.hasCancelBeenRequested()) {
               // clean up and exit
               throw new InterruptedException();
            }
         }
         
         // Now you'll want to have your application do something
         // with the data you just downloaded. So in this example,
         // lets suppose that a Swing component needs to be updated,
         // so recall that all Swing component changes need to be
         // the Swing event loop thread.
         SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
            public void run()
            {
               // Suppose textArea is a JTextArea GUI component
               textArea.setText( data.getTextLines() );
            }
         });

      // an IRunnagleWithProgress.run(pmon) method can't throw any
      // exceptions, so we have to catch them here.

      } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
         ie.printStackTrace();
         JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(jframe, ie.getMessage(),
                  "Cancel Notice", JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE);
      } catch (IOException ioe) {
         ioe.printStackTrace();
         JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(jframe, ioe.getMessage(),
                  "Error Notice", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);
      } finally {
         // if you call pmon.taskStarted(), then you MUST call this too:
         pmon.taskDone();
         
         // recall that finally clauses are executed even if there are exceptions
      }
   }


</pre>

In reality, I almost never write that much code for my long running operations.
The exception catching code (whcih pops up dialog boxes with the error message)
will be pretty much the same for all long running operations within an application.
So I create another application specific interface
that looks very much like an IRunnableWithProgress, but it allows for exceptions.
but then has another method, perhaps something like 
<pre>
  public interface MyFlavorOfRunnableWithProgress
  {
     doActualWork(IProgressMonitor pmon) throws InterruptedException, IOException, MyOtherException;
  }
</pre>
Then I create an implementation of an IRunnableWithProgress that takes
MyFlavorOfRunnableWithProgress in the constructor, and in its (no-exception
version) of the run method, it catches all the possible exceptions and
pops up dialog boxes. You can also decide here what to do about interrupted exceptions.
If  you want, you can pop up a dialog to let the user know that the operation was cancelled,
or you can just do nothing.

<br/>
&nbsp;
<br/>

It may be the case that the long running operation in your class will just turn around and
call another method to do its work. If you just have one other long running subtask to
invoke, you don't have to start, report to and close out the progress monitor.
You can let the single subtask do this for you.

<br/>
&nbsp;
<br/>

But if you have two or more long running subtasks, you have to go ahead and start the
progress monitor in your method, and then hand off sub-task progress monitors
for each subtask. There is an example of this near the bottom of the page.
Basically, each sub-task monitor is then given so many units of work on the
main task, but the top method takes responsibility for starting and finishing the
progress monitor.

<br/>
&nbsp;
<br/>

Here is an example of the doLongOperation() method where it just passes off
the progress monitoring responsibility to one sub task. Note that it lets the subtask
do all the starting, reporting and finishing of the progress monitor. It does trap exceptions.

<pre>
   public void doLongOperation(URL url, IProgressMonitor pmon)
   {
      try {
         pmon.setCurrentActivityLabel("Reading Text Data from " + url.toString());

         // Here is the main work which is done by another method
         // and the management of the progress monitor is also managed by the
         // other method.
         final StringVector lines = getTextInfoFromUrl(url, pmon);

         // We are updating a Swing component - so do this right!
         SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
            public void run()
            {
               numLinesInTextUrlLabel.setText("" + lines.size() + " lines");
            }
         });
      } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
         ie.printStackTrace();
         JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(jframe, ie.getMessage(),
                  "Cancel Notice", JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE);
      } catch (IOException ioe) {
         ioe.printStackTrace();
         JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(jframe, ioe.getMessage(),
                  "Error Notice", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);
      }
      
      // Note: a common mistake might be to put
      // pmon.taskDone();
      // here, but we just passed through thr pmon to another method
      // and that method is already calling taskDone(), so it would
      // be an error to call it here.
   }



   private StringVector getTextInfoFromUrl(URL url, IProgressMonitor pmon)
            throws IOException, InterruptedException
   {
      IURLLineReader reader = new PlainTextURLLineReader(
               AutoSensingURLConnector.createConnectorWithNoFTPCapability());
      return reader.getTextLines(url, pmon);
   }
</pre>


<h3>Sub-Tasks</h3>
<p>
A long task may consist of multiple subtasks. In this case, the overarching method
must claim responsibility for monitoring the progress and
divide up the work among sub-tasks. Its really not that hard.
Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>
   private ITimeSeriesTable readData(URL u, IProgressMonitor pmon)
     throws IOException, InterruptedException
   {
      // its better to use variables to capture the relataive work for each sub-task
      int workA = 500;
      int workB = 1000
      int totalWork = workA + workB;
      
      // This is just used to keep the same activity label as the parent
      String taskLabel = SubTaskProgressMonitor.getLabel(pmon,
                             "Reading url: " + url.toString());

      try {
         pmon.taskStarted(taskLabel, totalWork);

         SubTaskProgressMonitor subMonitorA = new SubTaskProgressMonitor(pmon, label, workA);
         URL [] urls = filefinder.findFiles(t1, t2, subMonitorA);

         SubTaskProgressMonitor subMonitorB = new SubTaskProgressMonitor(pmon, label, workB);
         return reader.readUrls(urls, subMonitorB);
         
         // Notice that you do not call taskDone() on the sub monitors.
         // That is the job of the method that recieves the (as far as it knows)
         // completely pristine progress monitor.
         
      } finally {
         // This tells the task (or sub-task) to go ahead and set its
         // work done to the full amount.
         pmon.taskDone();
      }
                             
   }
</pre>
<p>
You can see here why it is important for each long running operation to complete its task
by calling the <code>taskDone()</code> method.
If a sub-task leaves some work undone, the parent task gets messed up because it was totally
relying on the sub-task to do that work (i.e., report it as being done through the sub task
progress monitor methods), and now the progress bar is off.
Actually, this is not that big of a deal - it won't crash your code.
If your sub-task does too much work, that can prematurely close the progress window.
</p>

<p>
You can also have parts of your long operation do the work "in-house" and parts farmed out
to sub-tasks. Search around in the timeseries library for examples of this.
</p>

<p>
One final thing - if your sub task (any any task can be used in another task as a sub task!),
then there are cases where you don't know what the total amount of work is.
In this case, you should call the <code>pmon.setIndeterminate(true)</code> method
on the progress monitor. Then you don't need to report work being done, but you should
still check for cancellations. If you do report work done, then be very sure to
not report too much. Its tempting to just assign some amount that will be close for some cases
and just go with that, but this could make the progress bar complete too fast if your actual
amount of work for the sub task exceeds what you assinged to it.

Then, when your task is done, be sure to call <code>pmon.setInderminate(false)</code>
so that the parent monitor is not left stuck in indeterminate mode.
