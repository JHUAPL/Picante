/**
 * Contains a basic set of classes capturing components of an elementary three dimensional and two
 * dimensional vector space and a subset of linear transformations on it.
 * <p>
 * These two and three dimensional constructs are called out specifically rather than a treatment of
 * the general n-dimensional case given the focus of the library on dealing with the physical world.
 * For a treatment of n-dimensional vector spaces, packages like jama are helpful.

 * The classes in this package implement a particular form of the weak immutability design pattern.

 * TODO: Document the fact mtxv and mxv are not where Jon and Grant expected them to be!. The
 * classes in this package follow another slightly unusual design pattern that turns out to be
 * useful for mathematical constructs like vectors and matrices. If you are looking for binary or
