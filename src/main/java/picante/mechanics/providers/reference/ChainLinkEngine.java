/**
 * Package private class that implements the chain linkage algorithm utilized by both the reference
 * implementations of the ephemeris and frame provider interfaces. The class is parameterized to
 * allow it to function with any sort of time varying tree structure with load priority conflict
 * resolution.
 * 
 * In a nut shell, this class takes a list of functions that connect &quot;leaf&quot; nodes to
 * &quot;node&quot; nodes and provides an interface to connect them. Conflicts in definitions, i.e.
 * two functions provide a definition for the same leaf node are resolved through load order. Namely
 * the last applicable function provided at construction time is the first applicable.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b>This implementation of the link engine places a few constraints on the function list
 * provided to the constructor which are not enforced or checked for in the implementation. In the
 * most general case, at any requested time, there may be no functions that close nodes in the tree
 * into a cycle. I.e.:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; Ap
 * &circ;                   |
 * +-------------------+
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This can happen if Ap directly connects to A, or if the IDs for A and Ap are such that
 * A.equals(Ap), or Ap.equals(A). In the event this happens, then the response of the code is
 * unspecified. At worst, it may enter into an infinite loop evaluating links in the chain.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @param <I> Codes used to define nodes in the tree
 * @param <F> Functions used to connect nodes in the tree
 * @param <CP> An abstraction, or adapter, that queries the functions in a standard way for their
 *        codes and times. See {@link CodeProvider} for details.
